# Data submission instructions

In the following section we will explain the process and requirements for a team to submit forcasts to the forecasting competition.
All forecasts will be submitted to the [submissions/](./) folder as a parquet file follwing a predefined naming convention and data format. A detailed introduction of the naming convention and data format can be found below.

After having added the forecasting results a pull request to the *submission* branch of the competition repository can be created.
The submission will be checked and evaluated, if all requirements are met.

## Example

See [this folder](https://github.com/rki-daki-fws/forecast-competition/blob/main/examples) for an illustration of a (hypothetical) submission file. 
- `2021-03-31_testTeam_testModel_LK_cases.parquet` the hypothetical submission file
- `example.R`  a basic script showing the generation of a submission file in R

## Forecasting Results

### Summary

- daily cases or r-values
- time horizon of 28 days
- county (Landkreis) or states (Bundeland)
- 100 samples for each point in time and geographical entity

The teams will generate case or r-value forecasts for a time horizon of 28 days for either the German States (Bundesland) or Counties (Landkreis).  
Each forecast results file name should following this naming convention:

    YYYY-MM-DD_team_model_locationtype_targettype.parquet
    
where

- `YYYY` is the 4 digit year, 
- `MM` is the 2 digit month,
- `DD` is the 2 digit day,
- `team` is the name of the team, 
- `model` is the name of the model,
- `locationtype` is the kind of geographical entities for which forecasts are made (`LK` or `BL`) and
- `targettype` is either `cases` or `rvalue`. 

The date YYYY-MM-DD is the `model_date`, the latest date for which data is being used to fit the forecasting model. 

The teams are allowed to submit forecasts for Bundesländer and Landkreise. `location` can take any of the following values:

- `LK` this corresponds to County-level (Landkreis) or
- `BL` this corresponds to State-level (Bundesland)
 

Both `team` and `model` should be less than 15 characters, 
alpha-numeric, with no spaces, underscores or hyphens.


## Forecast results file format

The file must be a parquet file with the following columns (in any order):

- `target`
- `location`
- `sample_id`
- `value`

No additional columns are allowed.

A row is a realization (sample) of a forecast of either the number of cases or the r-value (`targettype`) for the specified `target` date and `location`.  

It is generally allowed to submit incomplete data i.e. some counties might be missing.

### `target`

Values in the `target` column must be a date in the format

    YYYY-MM-DD

This date corresponds to the forecasting date. For example if the `model_date` given in the file name is `2021-04-01` and the date in `target` is `2021-04-02` then `value` will hold the 1-day-ahead forecast.

### `location`

The values specified in `location` must match the definition of the `locationtype` in the results file name, such that if `LK` is the `locationtype` only valid counties (Landkreise) can be used in `location` and no states (Bundesländer). Same applies for `BL` as `locationtype`. 

#### County - Landkreis
The county ID is based on the official municipality key/Amtlicher Gemeindeschlüssel (AGS), which can be retrieved from the portal of [the Federal Statistical Office](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Laender-Regionen/Regionales/Gemeindeverzeichnis/Administrativ/Archiv/GVAuszugQ/AuszugGV2QAktuell.html). The county ID results from the code of the federal state (Land), the regional district (RB) and the county (LK). For a more accurate representation of Berlin, the 12 city districts are broken down as separate "Landkreise". Here we deviate from the specifications of the AGS. The following allocation is made:

| IdLandkreis | Bezirk | IdLandkreis | Bezirk |  
| ----------- | ------ | ----------- | ------ |  
|11001 | Berlin Mitte | 11007 | Berlin Tempelhof-Schöneberg |  
|11002 | Berlin Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg | 11008 | Berlin Neukölln |  
|11003 | Berlin Pankow | 11009 | Berlin Treptow-Köpenick |  
|11004 | Berlin Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf| 11010 | Berlin Marzahn-Hellersdorf |  
|11005 | Berlin Spandau | 11011 | Berlin Lichtenberg |  
|11006 | Berlin Steglitz-Zehlendorf | 11012 | Berlin Reinickendorf|  

#### State - Bundesland

Like the county Id is the State Id based on the AGS and is just the code of the federal state(Land).

| IdBundesland | Bundsland |  
| ----------- | ------ |   
| 01 |  Schleswig-Holstein |
| 02 |  Hamburg |
| 03 |  Niedersachsen |
| 04 |  Bremen |
| 05 |  Nordrhein-Westfalen |
| 06 |  Hessen |
| 07 |  Rheinland-Pfalz |
| 08 | Baden-Württemberg |
| 09 | Bayern |
| 10 | Saarland |
| 11 | Berlin |
| 12 | Brandenburg |
| 13 | Mecklenburg-Vorpommern |
| 14 | Sachsen |
| 15 | Sachsen-Anhalt |
| 16 | Thüringen |

### `sample_id`

For each unique combination of `location` and `target` multiple forecast `value`s will be submitted. This is meant to reflect the models uncertainty in the forecast. For 100 samples the `sample_id` will be an integer starting at one upto 100. For a forecasting horizon of 28 days one would essentially submit 100 different trajectories/time series of length 28 days.

### `value`

This is the actual value of the forecast. The are no restrictions other than the value of `value` being positive.
