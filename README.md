## How to

Fork the project, add your predictions as CSV to submissions directory.
The naming convention of the CSV is <teamname>-<modelname>.csv

You may not submit the same filename more than once. For updated results, please choose another model name or apply a version number, i.e. V2.

When you are ready to submit, create a pull request to the *submission* branch of the competition repository.
Your submission will be checked and evaluated, if all requirements are met.
